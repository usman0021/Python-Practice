# 🐍 Python Practice: Lists and Tuples

This repository contains practice exercises for **Python Lists** and **Tuples**, as part of an AI Generative & Chatbot Development course.  
The exercises help strengthen the understanding of Python’s core data structures — **mutable lists** and **immutable tuples**.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered

### ✅ Lists
- Creating and accessing list elements  
- Modifying lists (add, remove, update)  
- Looping through lists  
- List methods (`append()`, `insert()`, `pop()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, etc.)  
- Nested lists  
- List comprehension  
- Converting between lists and tuples  

### ✅ Tuples
- Creating and accessing tuples  
- Tuple slicing  
- Nested tuples  
- Tuple methods (`count()`, `index()`)  
- Iterating through tuples  
- Membership tests (`in`, `not in`)  
- Tuple unpacking  
- Converting between tuples and lists
